# Myers-Briggs-classifier

Project 3 Proposal: Classification model that predicts which of the 16 personality types someone fall into based off their social media activity. The data set used is the [kaggle MBTI DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type). NLP is used to count vectorize all the tweets for each person and label it with the personality type. Classification is binary for each of the 4 lettets. E/I, N/S, F/T, P/J

Myers Briggs is a popular personality test that attempts to classify and describe people's unique ways of interacting with the world, making decisions, and process information. There are a total of 16 personalities based on 4 personality traits: 1st introversion or extroversion, 2nd intuitive or sensing, 3rd feeling or thinking, 4th judging or perceiving. Each of the 16 personalities have a unique sequence of 8 functions that describe their cognitive tendencies.

One's myers briggs is usually determined by taking a long online test. Such tests are often subject to confirmation bias as people select answers based on their existing perception of themselves. Additionally, many are unsure about their responses as they fill out these questionaires. Turns out, we do not know as much about ourselves as we think.

Thus, I attempt to use machine learning to learn and predict myers briggs based on something more reliable: people's writing.
